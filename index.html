                        <p>Hi Everyone, my name is Sonia and I am a newbie to the coding world. The following page is an example of my first peice. With that said,
                            please treat it with much love and kindness. Now a little about me...after all this is an about me page (head nods, head nods).....I'm
                            a so-cali girl born and raised, who loves taco tuesdays, exploring/traveling the world, finding new places via yelp to live my once dream
                            to be, food critic, and dogs....specifically corgis... uuuhhh you'll see what I mean ;)
                        </p>
                        <p> Talk about cuteness overload rightttt!?!?!?.. okay back to me. Fun fact, I've completed two marathons in this life. My first was completed
                            at age 13 and the second at age 23. I've kinda vowed to myself that I'll complete one every ten years to complete the cycle. So number 33, 
                            I'm coming for you! I'll probably call it quits after age 63. I like to challenge myself which is why I keep this goal and why I joined
                            this bootcamp program. I'm nervous, scared, excited, happy for what the future holds but with cafeine I'm sure anything is possible.
                            Thank you for sticking through the end, this was great! Thanks, till next time.
                            </p>
